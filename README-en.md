- [@FZZkill](https://github.com/FZZkill): Help to beautify the README
- [@mail_set](https://space.bilibili.com/435654748) ([Personal Website](https://mailset.top)): Upload CMCL to AUR repository (named`cmcl`)

## üìï Tutorial
- If your operating system is Windows, you can download `cmcl.exe` in Releases, then open cmd, use `cd /d <directory path>` to open the directory where `cmcl.exe` is located, and execute the command `cmcl` , followed by options and parameters. If you want to use CMCL in any directory, please refer to ["How to use CMCL in any path?" in Troubleshooting](troubleshooting-en.md#how-to-use-cmcl-in-any-path).
- If your operating system is ArchLinux, you can use yay to install CMCL, the command is as follows:
```shell
yay -S cmcl
```
Then directly enter the command `cmcl`, followed by options and parameters.
- If your operating system is macOS, you can use Homebrew to install CMCL, the command is as follows:
```shell
brew tap MrShieh-X/brew
brew install cmcl
```
Then directly enter the command `cmcl`, followed by options and parameters. </br>
The command to update the launcher is:
```shell
brew update
brew upgrade cmcl
```
The command to uninstall is:
```shell
brew uninstall cmcl
```
- If you are other Linux users, or you are a macOS user, but do not want to use Homebrew to install, you can find the latest version in Releases, download `cmcl`, and then open the directory where `cmcl` is located in the terminal, execute `. /cmcl`, followed by options and parameters.
- If none of the above methods apply to you, you can find the latest version in Releases, download `cmcl.jar`, then open the directory where `cmcl.jar` is located in the terminal (or cmd under Windows), and execute the following command, Followed by options and parameters. This method is available on most operating systems.
```shell
java -jar cmcl.jar
```
For specific usage, please refer to [Help Documentation](#-help-documentation). If you want to modify the configuration of the launcher, please refer to [Configurations](#-configurations).

## üìñ Help Documentation
Get general help documentation via `cmcl -h` or `cmcl --help`<br/>
To get help documentation of a single function, add `-h` or `--help` after the function option, such as `cmcl account --help`<br/>
Note: Content in square brackets is optional. A comma in an option means that both options can do the same thing.<br/>
For specifying content for options, you can only add content directly after the abbreviated option (a hyphen) (no spaces), such as `cmcl -lD:\.minecraft`,<br/>
you can only add an equal sign after the complete option (two hyphens) and then enter the content, such as `cmcl --list=D:\.minecraft`,<br/>
or add a space after the two and then enter the content, such as `cmcl -l D:\.minecraft`; `cmcl --list D:\.minecraft`, for details, please refer to the example after the option description.<br/>
For some commands that may be entered frequently, you can set simplified commands, see ["Can I make a 'shortcut' for a command I type often?" in Troubleshooting](troubleshooting-en.md#can-i-make-a-shortcut-for-a-command-i-type-often).

## üîß Configurations
The configurations are storing in a JSON file named cmcl.json in the launcher running directory (`userDirectory/.config/cmcl` under Linux and macOS), you can edit them by a file editor (need to know JSON tutorial, recommended to backup before modification) or the program arguments `config <config name> <content>` (see Help Documentation Configuration Related).<br/>
If you edit configurations by a file editor, the configuration name and text configuration content need to be enclosed in double quotes ("").<br/>
If you edit by command, if the configuration content contains spaces, it needs to be enclosed in double quotes ("").<br/>
You can view the table below through the options `config --view`.<br/>
Note: For configurations whose type is Boolean, its value can be `true` which means "yes", or `false` which means "no".
